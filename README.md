# parsewiki
Parse Wikipedia page dump to manage page entities and revisions.

## Roadmap

* [ ] Get some data (directly reslting from the parsing, not just entities) and go to the professor
* [ ] Add a command line utility to specify the source of the dump(s)
* [ ] Add an importer for the configurations (Mongo, spark folder, executors conf...)

## How to...

For each new task:

* create a separate branch
* implement the task
* create pull request
* TEST that nothing is broken
* merge branch to `master`
